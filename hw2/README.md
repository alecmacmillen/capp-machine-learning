## README

This directory contains two files:

1. pipeline.py - module that includes all data loading, cleaning, exploring, transforming, and model training.

2. predict_credit.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that imports the functions of pipeline.py and applies them to the credit-data.csv file upon which the homework is based.

credit-data.csv is the input data for predict-credit.ipynb; that data file is not included in this repository for space reasons.
